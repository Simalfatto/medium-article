      <h2>
        A very impressive title
      </h2>
      <p>
        A short but really interesting text that everybody want to read because that's absolutely an awesome story to tell.
        Did you know that? I'm not sure you did. My guess is you're reading this just because you'd like to know where all of this is going,
        while it is obviously not going anywhere.

        But I'll stop making paragraphs. Just because.
